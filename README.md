Notes on deep learning

***Tips: Try to visualize as you learn.***

**In the lecture notes, especially for CNN, a lot of text has been given. Those are for better understanding of how those algorithms have been trained, and those algos work.**

However, you can skip those, if you just wanna have an overview of those algorithms.

Codes too...... :)
